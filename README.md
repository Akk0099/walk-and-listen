# Walk & Listen 

[Walk & Listen](https://google.com) is a semi-clone of [Drive & Listen](https://google.com) which is a project from a master's student in Munich. Was something some friends of mine found while browsing online and we spend quite sometime enjoying it. So I eventually decided I wanted to make something alike but this time instead of being while driving it would be while walking :D.

This project is one of my one day projects, it has a lot of things that can be improved and I'm aware of it,if you have any improvements you can msg me and if I eventually come around to make a V2 I'll take them into account. Please remind it's a one day project.
